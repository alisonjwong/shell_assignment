1.1 Commands
Get_ChiltItem has four columns with the names of Mode, LastWriteTIme, Length and Name. 
	The mode shows something like "d-----" and "-a----".
	LastWrteTime shows when the file was last accessed/edited. 
	The length shows nothing or "0".
	The name displays the name of the file. 

Get-Alias has three columns: CommandType, Name, and Version.
	CommandType always shows "Alias".
	Name shows a long list of different shorthand commands such as "% -> ForEach-Object", "compare -> Compare-Object", "diff -> Compare-Object". 
	Verion shows the version it is: "3.1.0.0"

1.2 Getting some help
Get-Help ri showed the Name, Syntax, Aliases, and Remarks.
When added with -Detailed, an extra paragraph was shown; Parameters.
	This showed "-Confirm, -Credential <pscredential>, Exclude <string[]>", etc. 
Get-Help under administrator:
	It added a Description paragraph. 
	Parameter is way more detailed. It includes a description of what each function does. It also gives six examples. 
gci - fi shell_assignment.txt
	This filtered the rest of the files and just showed the Mode, LastWriteTime, Length and Name for shell_assignment.txt.

2.1 Looking Around 
Get_Location/pwd
	Currently on CLI assignment. Used "cd \shell_magic\ to change the file. 
	Used pwd to check this. 
	now on shell_magic file. 
	No I do not see colours. 

2.2 Moving Around
cd stands for change directory. 
cd .. 
	This made it use the file that it was originally in. So it is now looking at the CLI assignment folder instead of shell_magic.
cd tab 
	Used this to move back to the folder I started aat to get back to the shell_magic folder. 

3.1 Creating an emptyfile
New-Item/ni
	When doing this, I ran into a problem. It asks for the path and to supply the values for the following parameters. 

3.2 Making directories 
New-Item command, -ItemType 
	I used the command New-Item -ItemType Directory Hello_World

3.3 Moving and Renaming Files
	I was not able to create a hello_world file as there is one that is already created. 
hello_world.bfe 
	It worked! I used New-Item -ItemType Directory hello_world.bfe
Moving hello_world.txt 
	I used Move-Item '.\hello world' .\hello_world.bfe\
Moving hello_world.txt back to shell_magic.
	I used the command: Move-Item '.\hello world' .\shell_magic\
*I made a mistake. I had an extra folder called shell_magic in the shell_magic folder which caused confusion. I accidentaly made a folder instead of a file called hello_world.bfe. I also had a problem where the hello_world.txt was in this folder, and was accidentaly renamed to shell_magic when trying to move this back to the shell_magic folder. To fix this issue, I first used Remove-Item -Recurse to remove the shell_magic folder and did the same with the hello_world.bfe file. I then used New-Item to create a hello_world.txt file. I then moved this file into the hello_world. I then moved this file back into the current direcotry by using ".". Then I made the hello_world folder the working directory and used ".." to move the hello_world.txt back into shell_magic using: Move-Item .\hello_world.txt ..

3.4 Copying Files
Difference between moving and copying a file is that the file you are copying will be in more than one folder.
Copying hello_world.txt
	I used copy-item .\hello_world.txt .\hello_world\ to move the text into the hello_world folder from the shell_magic folder.
Rename hello_world.txt
	To rename the file I first made the hello_world folder the working directory. Then I did: Rename-Item .\hello_world.txt .\world_hello.txt


3.5 Removing Files and Directories
Remove hello_world.txt from shell_magic
	I used Remove-Item .\hello_world.txt
Remove world_hello.txt from hello_world 
	I made hello_world the working directory and used Remove-Item .\world_hello.txt
Remove the whole hello_world folder 
	I made shell_magic the working directory and then used Remove-Item .\hello_world
